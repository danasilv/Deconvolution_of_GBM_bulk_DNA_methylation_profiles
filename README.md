This code performs deconvolution of GBM DNA methyaltion profiles into the following components:
1. Immune
2. Glia
3. Neuron
4. Malignant GBM stem-like cells (V4)
5. Malignant GBM differentiated1 cells (V6)
6. Malignant GBM differentiated2 cells (V5)
differentiated1 and differentiated2 are two DNA methylation flavors of the differentiated cells, and so when interested in the size of the differentiated component, one should sum: differentiated = differentiated1 + differentiated2


To run the code:
1. unzip the profiles
2. replace the file paths in the code with where you saved the profiles, your idat files and the results folder
